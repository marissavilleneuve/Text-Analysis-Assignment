# The Travels of Marco Polo: A Text Analysis

For our text analysis assignment, we decided to use [The Travels of Marco Polo](https://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft/marcopolo00polouoft_djvu.txt).  We input it into [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org) , [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html ) and [The Topic Modeling Tool](https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/) to see what would happen.

### Voyant
In Voyant, we used the tools Bubblelines and RezoViZ to look at the appearance of different places in the text.

With Bubblelines, by putting in different places we know Marco Polo visited, we could see the appearance of those places in the text and visualize his travels over the course of the book, in a way.

RezoViz was very useful because it could recognize place names as place names and created a visualization of them all with Marco Polo, the traveler, in the centre.  

### AntConc

To try and get more results we tried to import our text into Antconc. We had no luck with this program at all. The program would not recognize .txt files aside from those made in default word applications. Even after getting it to recognize our text, it didn`t cooperate. We got results like this by searching the word "Khan":

Clearly there was some other text that the program read, but we weren't able to figure out where from, or why. 

Not to be discouraged we tried another Antconc program, this time AntWordProfiler. Unlike AntConc, Profiler was able to recognize all of our .txt files, no matter what program they were created in. This program also yielded better results, but still left us confused.

It seems like using AntWordProfiler as a comparsion tool would lead to a more comprehensive view of the results, but just examining one body of text didn't provide us with a better understanding of the material than Voyant did with it's (relatively) easier interface, and illustrative visuals. 






### The Topic Modeling Tool

### Conclusions
We came to this assignment with the preconceived notions that The Travels of Marco Polo was at its heart about geography and that these tools would elucidate the relationships of the places within the novel or at least give a greater understanding of their role.  We did not end up learning anything overly exciting about the text due to the time spent struggling with the tools more than anything.  With Voyant, the tool we were most familiar with, we were able to do the most, through its ability to network places.  But all the tools mostly worked to reaffirm our base assumption that the book was about geography.
