# The Travels of Marco Polo: A Text Analysis

For our text analysis assignment, we decided to use [The Travels of Marco Polo](https://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft/marcopolo00polouoft_djvu.txt).  We input it into [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org) , [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html ) and [The Topic Modeling Tool](https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/) to see what would happen.

### Voyant
In Voyant, we used the tools Bubblelines and RezoViZ to look at the appearance of different places in the text.

With Bubblelines, by putting in different places we know Marco Polo visited, we could see the appearance of those places in the text and visualize his travels over the course of the book, in a way.

RezoViz was very useful because it could recognize place names as place names and created a visualization of them all with Marco Polo, the traveler, in the centre.

### Conclusions
We came to this assignment with the preconceived notions that The Travels of Marco Polo was at its heart about geography and that these tools would elucidate the relationships of the places within the novel or at least give a greater understanding of their role.  We did not end up learning anything overly exciting about the text due to the time spent struggling with the tools more than anything.  With Voyant, the tool we were most familiar with, we were able to do the most, through its ability to network places.  But all the tools mostly worked to reaffirm our base assumption that the book was about geography.
